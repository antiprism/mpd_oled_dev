# Install instructions for Moode 7 using source

These instructions are for installing mpd_oled using source on
Moode 7 (with a 32-bit kernel architecture).

A binary package is also available, but may not include the very
latest code, see
[Install instructions for Moode 7](install_moode7_deb.md).

## Base system

Install [Moode](http://moodeaudio.org/). Ensure a command line prompt is
available for entering the commands below (e.g. use SSH, enable in the Moode UI
at **Configure / System / Local Services / SSH term server**, log in with
default username 'pi', default password 'moodeaudio').

## Install all dependencies

Install all the packages needed to build and run cava and mpd_oled
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install autoconf make libtool libfftw3-dev libmpdclient-dev libi2c-dev i2c-tools lm-sensors
```

## Build and install cava

mpd_oled uses Cava, a bar spectrum audio visualizer, to calculate the spectrum
   
   <https://github.com/karlstav/cava>

If you have Cava installed (try running `cava -h`), there is no need
to install Cava again, but to use the installled version you must use
`mpd_oled -k ...`.

Download, build and install Cava. These commands build a reduced
feature-set executable called `mpd_oled_cava`.
```
git clone https://github.com/karlstav/cava
cd cava
./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-input-portaudio --disable-input-sndio --disable-output-ncurses --disable-input-pulse --program-prefix=mpd_oled_
make
sudo make install-strip
cd ..    # leave cava directory
```

## Build and install mpd_oled

Download and build libu8g2arm (running `make` might take two hours on a
Pi Zero)
```
git clone https://github.com/antiprism/libu8g2arm
cd libu8g2arm
./bootstrap
mkdir build
cd build
CPPFLAGS="-W -Wall -Wno-psabi" ../configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
cd ../..  # leave libu8g2arm/build directory
```

Download, build and install mpd_oled.
```
git clone https://github.com/antiprism/mpd_oled_dev
cd mpd_oled_dev
./bootstrap
LIBU8G2_DIR=../libu8g2arm CPPFLAGS="-W -Wall -Wno-psabi" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install-strip
```

## System settings

Configure your system to enable I2C or SPI, depending on how your OLED
is connected.

### I2C
I use a cheap 4 pin I2C SSH1106 display with a Raspberry Pi Zero. It is
[wired like this](wiring_i2c.png).

In /etc/modules I have the line `i2c-dev`
```
sudo nano /etc/modules
```

In /boot/config.txt I have the line `dtparam=i2c_arm=on`.
The I2C bus speed on your system may be too slow for a reasonable screen
refresh. Set a higher bus speed by adding
the following line `dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=400000` to
/boot/config.txt, or try a higher value for a higher screen refresh
(I use `dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=800000` with a 25 FPS screen refresh)
```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Restart the Pi after making any system configuration changes.

### SPI
I use a cheap 7 pin SPI SSH1106 display with a Raspberry Pi Zero. It is
[wired like this](wiring_spi.png).
In /boot/config.txt I have the line `dtparam=spi=on`.
```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Restart the Pi after making any system configuration changes.

## Configure song status and time zone

Enable the Moode metadata file, which includes information about the
current song. You can either do this in the Moode UI at
**Moode / Configure / System / Local Services / Metadata file**,
or by running the following command
```
sqlite3 /var/local/www/db/moode-sqlite3.db "update cfg_system set value=1 where param='extmeta'" && mpc add ""

```
Go to the Moode UI and set your timezone at **Moode / Configure / System**.

## Configure a copy of the playing audio for the spectrum display

### Configure a copy on Moode 7.2 and later

Starting with Moode 7.2, the Moode UI provides an option to create a
copy of the playing audio. Go to **Configure / Audio / ALSA Options**,
set ALSA Loopback to ON and click on SET. Now
[Configure mpd_oled and set to run at boot](#configure-mpd_oled-and-set-to-run-at-boot).

### Configure a copy on Moode 7.0 and 7.1

The audio copy will be made using an ALSA configuration. To enable
this configuration a graphic equalizer **must** be set (in the Moode UI).

Install the audio copy with
```
sudo mpd_oled_moode_audio_copy_install
```
Read the report that is printed. If you already have a similar configuration
in `/etc/asound.conf` it will *not* be overwritten, and you may need to delete
it first and rerun the command (or leave it if it is already working).

If the installation completed successfully (or is assumed to be compatible
with mpd_oled) then reboot the machine
```
sudo reboot
```
When it has rebooted, open the Moode UI and enable a graphic equaliser
(e.g.  Graphic Eq with the 'flat' setting) if one is not already set.

An audio copy should now be available to read from `plughw:Loopback,1` (see below).

Note 1: enabling the loopback device may change the card number of your
playback device. If you hear no audio then reselect your device in the Moode UI.

Note 2: some Moode settings (e.g. certain SoX settings) may be incompatible
with the graphic equaliser, and therefore produce an ALSA error when
the equaliser is enabled. If you need these settings then you will need
to customise the ALSA configuration.

Please report issues, or ask for help with the spectrum display not working, at
[Moode ALSA audio copy issues](https://github.com/antiprism/mpd_oled/issues/65).

## Configure mpd_oled and set to run at boot

*Note: The program can be run without the audio copy enabled, in*
*which case the spectrum analyser area will be blank*

Install a service file. This will overwrite an existing mpd_oled
service file
```
sudo mpd_oled_service_install
```

The mpd_oled program can now be run with `sudo mpd_oled_service_edit` (plus
options), and this also sets up mpd_oled with the same options as a service
to be run at boot. Rerunning `sudo mpd_oled_service_edit` with different
options will stop the current running mpd_oled and start it again with
the new options. (Test commands can also be run with `mpd_oled` (plus
options), and stopped with Ctrl-C, but ensure that no other copy of
mpd_oled is running).

The OLED configuration MUST be specified with -o, and is a list of values
and settings separated by commas. The first three parts are required, and
specify (in order) the OLED controller, model and communicatons protocol. See
[OLED configuration with option -o](https://github.com/antiprism/mpd_oled_dev#oled-configuration-with-option--o)
(or run `mpd_oled -o help`) for full details. Examples
* Adafruit
  - `SSD1306,128X64,SPI`
  - `SSD1306,128X64,SPI,dc=24,reset=25`
  - `SSD1306,128X64,I2C`
  - `SSD1309,128X64,SPI`
  - `SSD1309,128X64,I2C`
* SH1196
  - `SH1106,128X64,SPI`
  - `SH1106,128X64,SPI,dc=24,reset=25`
  - `SH1106,128X64,I2C`

An example command, for a generic I2C SH1106 display with
a display of 10 bars and a gap of 1 pixel between bars and a framerate
of 20Hz is
```
sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o SH1106,128X64,I2C -b 10 -g 1 -f 20 -c alsa,plughw:Loopback,1
```

Add extra controller settings to the option -o argument after the
contoller, model, and protocol parts, in the form `,setting_name=value`.

**For I2C OLEDs** you may need to specify the I2C
address, find this by running, e.g. `sudo i2cdetect -y 1` and then specify
the address with the `i2c_address` setting, e.g.
`sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o SH1106,128X64,I2C,i2c_address=3d ...`.
If you have a reset pin connected, specify the GPIO number with the
`reset` setting, e.g.
`sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o SH1106,128X64,I2C,reset=24 ...`.
Specify the I2C bus number, if not 1, with the `bus_number` setting, e.g.
`sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o SH1106,128X64,I2C,bus_number=0 ...`.

**For, SPI OLEDs** you *must* specify your DC GPIO number with `dc`, and
you may need to specify your reset pin GPIO number with `reset`, e.g.
`sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o SH1106,128X64,SPI,dc=24,reset=25 ...`.
Specify the SPI bus number, if not 0, with `bus_number` setting, and
the CS number, if not 0, with the `cs_number` setting, e.g.
`sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o SH1106,128X64,SPI,bus_number=1,cs_number=1 ...`.

If your display is upside down, you can rotate it 180 degrees with setting
`rotate=2`, e.g.
`sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o SH1106,128X64,I2C,rotate=2 ...`.

Once the display is working, play some music and check the spectrum display
is working and is synchronised with the music. If there are no bars then the
audio copy may not have been configured correctly. If the bars seem jerky
or not synchronized with the music then reduce the values of -b and/or -f.

If you run `sudo mpd_oled_service_edit` without options the service
file will open in an editor, allowing the full service file to be
changed, and not just the mpd_oled options.

If the mpd_oled options are valid the display will be started after
the editor is closed, and will also be configured to start a boot

Check the program is working correctly by looking at the display while
the player is stopped, paused and playing music.


### Extra commands to control the service

Commands from the following list can be run to control the service
(they do not need to be run from the mpd_oled directory)
```
sudo systemctl enable mpd_oled    # start mpd_oled at boot
sudo systemctl disable mpd_oled   # don't start mpd_oled at boot
sudo systemctl start mpd_oled     # start mpd_oled now
sudo systemctl stop mpd_oled      # stop mpd_oled now
sudo systemctl status mpd_oled    # report the status of the service
```

## Uninstall

Uninstall the mpd_oled service (just the service, not the mpd_oled programs
or documentation), and the audio copy with
```
sudo mpd_oled_service_uninstall
sudo mpd_oled_moode_audio_copy_uninstall
```
